Keyboard Play" is a project that I created mainly for an intrapersonal communication scene presentation. It provides a convenient way to play audio by simply pressing a button. When the button is pressed, a corresponding sound will be played. This project is particularly useful for individuals who want to practice their public speaking or presentation skills by recording their own voice and playing it back through the keyboard.
